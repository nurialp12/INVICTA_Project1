## Fatal Fury: The Game
Recreation of the the game Fatal Fury.
Fatal Fury is a fighting game series developed by SNK for the Neo Geo system which allowed player to choose one of three characters to fight against eight computer controlled characters.
The gameplay follows the typical formula of most fighting games: 
the player fights against their opponent in best two-out-of-three matches. 
Each of the playable characters has special techniques that are performed by inputting specific commands in combination with the joystick and buttons. 
Fatal Fury was developed around the same time as Street Fighter II but Fatal Fury focused more on the timing of special moves and storytelling instead of the combos which Street Fighter II emphasised.
